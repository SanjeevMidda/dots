            Postmodernism is a philosophical and cultural movement that emerged
            in the mid-20th century, questioning and challenging traditional
            ideas, structures, and beliefs. It often involves skepticism toward
            grand narratives, embraces eclecticism, and blurs the boundaries
            between high and low culture. Postmodernism influences various
            fields, including art, literature, architecture, and philosophy,
            encouraging a more fragmented and diverse approach to creativity and
            expression.Postmodernism is a philosophical and cultural movement
